        <h2> Projects and Activies</h2>
        <p>An evergreen listing of the various projects and activities I have been working on:</p>
        
        <ul class="project">
          
           <li><a href="http://www.github.com" target="_blank"><b>STEM For Underserved Kids</b></a></li><br><br>
            <img src="images/projects/STEMKids.jpg" alt="STEM Project example child playing chess with a Robot" height="60%" width="60%"> 
            <p>Wanting to offer my own children proper yet fun and effective STEM opportunities that are also functional and applicable in the "Real World" we noticed a quite frankly disparaging gap in what was being offered in the Hickman School district area verses the wonderful options and opportunites that are being offered just 10 minutes away at the elite Lee's Summit school district area.</p>          
            <p>This is not just a school district problem, it is one that our community needs to come together and resolve for ourselves to help our children have choices of activities that can provide them with the skills to be productive, constructive and be exposed to positivity rather than self-destruction.</p>          
            <p><b>It is time we ask ourselves</b>: what do our kids do before and after school or during vacation and what are the options that they have to choose from? </p>          
            <p>We as a community have an opportunity to make STEM an important daily part of their lives and extra-curricula activities. We need to bring STEM up to the same or higher status as fashion, sports and entertainment has been with our children; perhaps we can brainstorm as a community and infuse them so that STEM can be a part of their mainstream as well.</p> 
              <p>We are looking to connect with other like-minded individuals who are willing to step out of your box, learn new things and take the time to guide our childrens interests; rather than fall into the old cliche of "finding themselves" later in life.  What is norm vs. alien to them is primarily based on what we more consistenly present to them.</p><br><br><br>
          
           <li><a href="http://www.github.com" target="_blank"><b>Medical &amp; Nutritional Administration app</b></a></li><br><br>
            <img src="images/projects/placeholder1.jpg" alt="Placeholder1 picture for Med and Nutritional application" height="60%" width="60%">
            <p>Will be designed to be an assistive application to primarily help those who require a full days regimented schedule of taking medications and nutritional needs.</p>           
            <p>It will supply multiple alarming with editable captioning, Medication and Nutritional lists can be added and edited as needed, have tracking for reporting and the ability to send reports to your medical team per email</p><br><br><br>
